        bangladesh GDP growth averaged over 6% from the decade following 2009 when the AL-led Grand Alliance of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina came to 
        office. This growth had been largely driven by its exports of ready made garments, remittances and the domestic agricultural sector. The country has pursued 
        export-oriented industrialisation, with its key export sectors include textiles, shipbuilding, fish and seafood, jute and leather goods. It has also developed
         self-sufficient industries in pharmaceuticals, steel and food processing. Bangladesh's telecommunication industry has witnessed rapid growth over the years, 
         receiving high investment from foreign companies. Bangladesh also has substantial reserves of natural gas and is Asia's seventh largest gas producer. Offshore
          exploration activities are increasing in its maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal. It also has large deposits of limestone.[40] The government promotes the
           Digital Bangladesh scheme as part of its efforts to develop the country's growing information technology sector.
        
        Bangladesh is strategically important for the economies of Nepal and Bhutan, as Bangladeshi seaports provide maritime access for these landlocked regions and countries.[41][42][43] China also views Bangladesh as a potential gateway for its landlocked southwest, including Tibet, Sichuan and Yunnan.
        
        Bangladesh is a member of the D-8 Organization for Economic Cooperation, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, the International Monetary Fund, 
        the World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The economy faces challenges of infrastructure bottlenecks, 
        bureaucratic corruption, and youth unemployment. </p>

        <h3><u>Ancient Bengal</u></h3>
        <p>Ancient Bengal was the site of several major Janapadas (kingdoms), while the earliest cities date back to the Vedic period. East Bengal—the eastern segment 
          of Bengal—was a historically prosperous region.<sup>[44]</sup>The Ganges Delta provided advantages of a mild, almost tropical climate, fertile soil, ample
           water, and an abundance of fish, wildlife, and fruit.[44] The standard of living is believed to have been higher compared with other parts of South Asia.
           <sup>[44</sup>] As early as the thirteenth century, the region was developing as an agrarian economy.<sup>[44]</sup>Bengal was the junction of trade routes on the Southeastern 
           Silk Road.<sup>[44]</sup> </p>
